## Simple OpenGL "Emulator"

not finished yet. Just link GLIMPL.CPP and include GL.H to your WatcomC project. 

May also work in other (non Dos) environments.

Current hot topics: barycentric coordinates cause polygon edges to be calculated incorrectly (in seldom cases).

Currently you can just paint all the usual and normal OpenGL stuff. Maybe the lighting is calculated incorrectly too.

For some fun: link MAIN.CPP and OSA.CPP to see "Yellow Rose of Texas" a 4k by Fit and Bandwagon.
