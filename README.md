## Simple OpenGL "Emulator"

not finished yet. Just link GLIMPL.CPP and include GL.H to your WatcomC project. 

May also work in other (non Dos) environments.

Current hot topics: barycentric coordinates cause polygon edges to be calculated incorrectly (in seldom cases).

For some fun: link MAIN.CPP and OSA.CPP to see "Yellow Rose of Texas" a 4k by Fit and Bandwagon.

Btw. seems like NVidia and maybe AMD are keeping the support for Vesa (under Dos).

This OpenGL "Emulation" is purely in software "slow" and not optimized yet. 

Multithreading is planned (if a multithreading lib for Dos pops up somewhere).
