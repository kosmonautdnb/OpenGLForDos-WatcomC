## Simple OpenGL "Emulator"

not finished yet, but it already works. Just link GLIMPL.CPP and include GL.H.

Current hot topics: Nearplane clipping and barycentric coordinates cause polygon edges to be calculated incorrectly.

Currently you can just paint all the usual and normal OpenGL stuff. Maybe the lighting is calculated incorrectly too.

For some fun: link MAIN.CPP and OSA.CPP to see "Yellow Rose of Texas" a 4k by Fit and Bandwagon.
